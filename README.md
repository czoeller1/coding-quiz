# coding-quiz

A small quiz program composed of 5 web development related questions. The user has 60 seconds to answer all of them, with 10 seconds being deducted if they answer incorrectly. The user's score is their time remaining after answering all 5 questions, or -1 if they run out of time. The user is then prompted to enter their initials and the name/score combo is added to a persistent scoreboard in local browser storage. On the scoreboard page the user has the option to return to the start screen and clear the leaderoard.
